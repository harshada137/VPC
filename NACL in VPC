In AWS (Amazon Web Services), **NACL** stands for **Network Access Control List**. It's a **virtual firewall** for controlling **inbound and outbound traffic** at the **subnet level** within a **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**.

### üîê **Key Features of NACL:**

1. **Subnet-level Security:**

   * NACLs operate at the **subnet level**, unlike security groups which operate at the instance level.

2. **Stateless:**

   * NACLs are **stateless**, meaning **you must define both inbound and outbound rules** explicitly.
   * Responses to allowed inbound traffic are **not automatically allowed** outbound.

3. **Rule Evaluation:**

   * Rules are evaluated in **numbered order** from lowest to highest.
   * The **first matching rule** is applied.
   * If no rule matches, the default is **deny**.

4. **Allow & Deny:**

   * NACLs support **both allow and deny rules** (unlike security groups which only allow).

5. **Default NACL:**

   * Every VPC has a default NACL that **allows all inbound and outbound traffic**.
   * You can customize it or create custom NACLs.

6. **Associated with Subnets:**

   * A subnet can be associated with **only one NACL** at a time.
   * But one NACL can be associated with **multiple subnets**.

### üìä **NACL vs. Security Group:**

| Feature         | NACL                | Security Group            |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Level           | Subnet              | Instance                  |
| Stateful        | No (stateless)      | Yes                       |
| Allow/Deny      | Allow and Deny      | Only Allow                |
| Evaluated Order | Rule number order   | All rules evaluated       |
| Association     | One NACL per subnet | Multiple SGs per instance |

### üßæ **Example NACL Rule:**

**Inbound Rule:**

| Rule # | Type | Protocol | Port Range | Source    | Allow/Deny |
| ------ | ---- | -------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 100    | HTTP | TCP      | 80         | 0.0.0.0/0 | ALLOW      |
| \*     | ALL  | ALL      | ALL        | 0.0.0.0/0 | DENY       |

**Outbound Rule:**

| Rule # | Type  | Protocol | Port Range | Destination | Allow/Deny |
| ------ | ----- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 100    | HTTPS | TCP      | 443        | 0.0.0.0/0   | ALLOW      |
| \*     | ALL   | ALL      | ALL        | 0.0.0.0/0   | DENY       |
