A Jump Server (also called Bastion Host) in a VPC is a special-purpose instance used to securely connect to instances in a private subnet that donâ€™t have direct internet access.


---

Why Use a Jump Server?
Private instances do not have public IPs.
You can't SSH directly into them from the internet.
A Jump Server bridges the gap, allowing secure SSH/RDP access to private resources.

---

Typical Setup:
1. Jump Server is launched in a public subnet with:
    *A public IP address
    *Appropriate security group rules (e.g., allow port 22 from your IP)

2. Target private EC2 instances are in a private subnet.

3. SSH into the Jump Server, then use it to SSH into the private instances.

Security Best Practices:
Use key-based SSH authentication.
Allow SSH (port 22) only from your IP (restrict access).
Use IAM roles and session logging if integrating with AWS Systems Manager.
Optionally, use Session Manager (from AWS SSM) as a more secure, auditable alternative to Jump Servers.
