 What is a Subnet?
A subnet (short for subnetwork) is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources (like EC2 instances) into a subnet.

Types of Subnets
Public Subnet
Connected to the internet via an Internet Gateway (IGW).
Typically used for resources that must be accessible from the internet, like web servers.

Private Subnet
No direct internet access.
Used for resources like databases, application servers, or backend services.
Can connect to the internet via a NAT Gateway in a public subnet (for outgoing requests).

| Term                       | Description                                                                                      |

| **CIDR Block**             | Defines the IP range of the subnet (e.g., `10.0.1.0/24`).                                        |
| **Route Table**            | Controls how traffic is routed from the subnet (to the internet, other subnets, etc.).           |
| **Availability Zone (AZ)** | Each subnet exists in a single AZ for high availability. You can create subnets in multiple AZs. |
| **NAT Gateway**            | Allows private subnets to access the internet (e.g., for updates) without being exposed.         |


 Why Use Subnets?
1. Security: Isolate resources by subnet type (public vs. private).
2. Control: Manage routing and access with route tables and security groups.
3. Availability: Deploy across multiple AZs for redundancy
