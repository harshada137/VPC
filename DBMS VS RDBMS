1. Data Storage:
DBMS: Stores data as files or in a hierarchical format.
RDBMS: Stores data in tabular form using rows and columns.

2. Data Relationships:
DBMS: Does not support relationships between data.
RDBMS: Supports relationships through primary and foreign keys.

3. Data Redundancy:
DBMS: High data redundancy.
RDBMS: Reduces redundancy through normalization.

4. Data Integrity:
DBMS: Less emphasis on data integrity.
RDBMS: Ensures high data integrity with constraints and rules.

5. Users:
DBMS: Supports single users.
RDBMS: Supports multiple users simultaneously.

6. ACID Compliance:
DBMS: May not support full ACID properties.
RDBMS: Fully supports ACID properties.

7. Security Features:
DBMS: Limited security features.
RDBMS: Advanced security with roles, permissions, etc.

8. Normalization:
DBMS: Normalization is not used.
RDBMS: Uses normalization to organize data efficiently.

9. Examples:
DBMS: File System, XML, MS Access (basic).
RDBMS: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

10. Performance with Large Data:
DBMS: Poor performance with large volumes of data.
RDBMS: Optimized for handling large datasets efficiently.
