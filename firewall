🔥 What is a Firewall in Networking?
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network (like your home
or office network) and untrusted external networks (such as the internet).

🔐 Purpose of a Firewall:
- Prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network.
- Protect systems from malicious attacks, viruses, and hackers.
- Filter traffic based on IP addresses, ports, protocols, or applications.

🛠️ How Firewalls Work:
- A firewall inspects each packet of data that tries to enter or leave the network. Based on its configuration, it will:
- Allow (Permit) the traffic if it meets the rules.
- Deny (Block) the traffic if it violates the rules.

| Parameter      | Value            |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Source IP      | `192.168.1.0/24` |
| Destination IP | `10.0.0.5`       |
| Protocol       | TCP              |
| Port           | 80 (HTTP)        |
| Action         | Allow            |


🧠 Key Concepts:
- Ingress Traffic: Incoming traffic to your network.
- Egress Traffic: Outgoing traffic from your network.
- Whitelist: A list of allowed sources/destinations.
- Blacklist: A list of denied sources/destinations.
- DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): A neutral zone used to host public-facing services, isolated from the internal network for security.

📌 Common Use Cases:
- Protecting websites from DDoS and SQL injection attacks.
- Blocking access to certain websites or IPs.
- Monitoring employee internet usage.
- Creating a secure perimeter for IoT and cloud applications.

🛡️ Benefits of a Firewall:
- Enhances network security.
- Provides control over traffic.
- Helps prevent data breaches.
- Ensures compliance with security standards.
