Three-tier architecture is a software architecture pattern that separates an application into three logical and physical layers:

---

1. Presentation Tier (Web Tier):
Purpose: 
Serves the frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) and handles HTTP requests.

Technologies:
Nginx: Acts as a web server and/or reverse proxy to handle incoming requests.

AWS Services:
Amazon EC2: Host Nginx and PHP (e.g., Ubuntu with Nginx, PHP, PHP-FPM).
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
Amazon CloudFront: (Optional) for global CDN.
Amazon S3: (Optional) for static assets (images, JS, CSS).


---

2. Application Tier (Logic Tier):

Purpose:
Processes dynamic requests and business logic.

Technologies:
PHP & PHP-FPM: PHP scripts processed using PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager).

AWS Services:
Amazon EC2: Runs PHP application with PHP-FPM.
Amazon Elastic Beanstalk: (Optional) for easier PHP app deployment.
Amazon ECS: For containerized PHP apps (if Docker is used).
AWS Lambda: (If serverless functions are needed).


---

3. Data Tier (Database Tier):
Purpose: 
Stores and manages application data.

AWS Services:
Amazon RDS: Relational databases like MySQL/PostgreSQL for PHP apps.
Amazon Aurora: High-performance managed MySQL/PostgreSQL.
Amazon ElastiCache: (Optional) for caching with Redis or Memcached.

---

Example Flow:

1. User request → Nginx on EC2
2. Nginx forwards PHP request → PHP-FPM
3. PHP logic processes data → Fetches/stores in RDS
4. Response returned to user

Advantages of AWS Three-Tier Architecture:

Scalability: Each layer can scale independently.

High Availability: Built-in redundancy and failover options.

Security: Each tier can be isolated using VPCs, security groups, and IAM.
